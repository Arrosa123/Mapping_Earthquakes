# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. So, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Results:
By using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, geoJSON data, and tectonic plate data displayed the earthquake data and tectonic plate data on the map when the page loads and the datasets can be toggled on or off with three map styles.
